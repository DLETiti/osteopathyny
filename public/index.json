With years of experience, she treats everyone from newborns to the elderly using gentle, hands-on techniques that support the body\u0026rsquo;s natural ability to heal.\nWhy Osteopathy #Structure affects function. Anatomy affects physiology. The human body is a complex organism in which everything — bones, muscles, nerves, blood and lymphatic vessels, fascia and fluid — is all one.\nThe body grows, it self-regulates, it heals. These very subtle forces and motions are continuous, just as respiration, and are palpable to the osteopathic medical physician. If these life processes are impaired by trauma, illness, habit, or poor adaptation, physiology — and thereby function — will not be optimal.\nThe osteopathic medical physician can feel these disruptions (somatic dysfunction) and gently, with manipulation, assist the patient in reorganizing their physiology to promote health.\nIf you have any questions, please call or email — Dr. Ventimiglia is always happy to discuss how osteopathy can apply to your situation.\n","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/","section":"Melissa Ventimiglia, D.O.","summary":"","title":"Melissa Ventimiglia, D.O."},{"content":"Dr. Ventimiglia provides osteopathic manipulative medicine across several areas of specialty.
