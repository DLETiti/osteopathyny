Welcome to my osteopathic practice. I'm Melissa Ventimiglia, D.O., and I specialize in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), serving the greater New York City area. I've spent over two decades treating everyone from newborns to the elderly using gentle, hands-on techniques that support the body's natural ability to heal.

## Why Osteopathy

Structure affects function. Anatomy affects physiology. The human body is a complex organism in which everything — bones, muscles, nerves, blood and lymphatic vessels, fascia and fluid — is all one.

The body grows, it self-regulates, it heals. These very subtle forces and motions are continuous, just as respiration, and are palpable to the osteopathic medical physician. If these life processes are impaired by trauma, illness, habit, or poor adaptation, physiology — and thereby function — will not be optimal.

As an osteopathic medical physician, I can feel these disruptions (somatic dysfunction) and gently, with manipulation, assist the patient in reorganizing their physiology to promote health.

If you have any questions, please [call](tel:+12126626560) or [email](mailto:drv@melissaventimiglia.com) — I am always happy to discuss how osteopathy can apply to your situation.
