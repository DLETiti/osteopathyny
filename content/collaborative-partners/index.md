I believe in a team approach to patient care. I collaborate with professionals across several disciplines to ensure comprehensive treatment.

## Dentists & Orthodontists

I work with dentists who use the Advanced Lightwire Functional (ALF) appliance. My osteopathic care supports the structural changes taking place throughout the body as patients undergo ALF treatment.

## Myofunctional Therapists

Myofunctional therapy addresses the muscles and functions of the face and mouth. I collaborate with myofunctional therapists as part of the ALF treatment team, ensuring that structural and functional goals are aligned.

## Lactation Consultants

I work closely with lactation consultants throughout NYC, particularly when infants present with structural issues that may affect breastfeeding.
