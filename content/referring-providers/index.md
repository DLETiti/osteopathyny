I welcome referrals from healthcare professionals and work collaboratively to ensure continuity of care for shared patients.

## When to Refer

Osteopathic manipulative medicine may benefit patients experiencing:

- Musculoskeletal pain that hasn't responded fully to other treatments
- Infants with feeding difficulties, torticollis, cranial asymmetry, reflux, or colic
- Patients who would benefit from a whole-body, structural approach
- Pre- and postnatal musculoskeletal concerns
- Conditions involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)

## For Lactation Consultants

I work closely with lactation consultants throughout NYC. If you're working with an infant who has:

- A shallow or painful latch
- Difficulty turning to one side during feeding
- Tension or restriction that may be affecting feeding ability
- Torticollis or cranial asymmetry

...osteopathic evaluation and treatment may address the structural component of these challenges. I am happy to discuss any case and provide feedback on whether OMM may be appropriate.
