Dr. Ventimiglia welcomes referrals from healthcare professionals and works collaboratively to ensure continuity of care for shared patients.

## When to Refer

Osteopathic manipulative medicine may benefit patients experiencing:

- Musculoskeletal pain that hasn't responded fully to other treatments
- Infants with feeding difficulties, torticollis, cranial asymmetry, reflux, or colic
- Patients who would benefit from a whole-body, structural approach
- Pre- and postnatal musculoskeletal concerns
- Conditions involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)

## For Lactation Consultants

Dr. Ventimiglia works closely with lactation consultants throughout NYC. If you're working with an infant who has:

- A shallow or painful latch
- Difficulty turning to one side during feeding
- Tension or restriction that may be affecting feeding ability
- Torticollis or cranial asymmetry

...osteopathic evaluation and treatment may address the structural component of these challenges. Dr. Ventimiglia is happy to discuss any case and provide feedback on whether OMM may be appropriate.
