## How OMM Differs from Other Approaches

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** *Dr. V to describe in her own words: How does osteopathic manipulative medicine differ from chiropractic care or physical therapy? What makes her approach unique?*

Osteopathic manipulative medicine takes a whole-body approach. Rather than focusing only on the area of pain, Dr. Ventimiglia evaluates how the body's structure and function relate to one another — identifying areas of restriction or imbalance that may be contributing to symptoms.

## What to Expect

Treatment is gentle and hands-on. Dr. Ventimiglia uses a variety of osteopathic techniques tailored to each patient's needs and comfort level.
