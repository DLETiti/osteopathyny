## How OMM Differs from Other Approaches

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** *To describe in my own words: How does osteopathic manipulative medicine differ from chiropractic care or physical therapy? What makes my approach unique?*

Osteopathic manipulative medicine takes a whole-body approach. Rather than focusing only on the area of pain, I evaluate how the body's structure and function relate to one another — identifying areas of restriction or imbalance that may be contributing to symptoms.

## What to Expect

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** *To describe: What happens during an adult's first visit? How long is a typical session? How frequently do patients come in?*

Treatment is gentle and hands-on. I use a variety of osteopathic techniques tailored to each patient's needs and comfort level.
