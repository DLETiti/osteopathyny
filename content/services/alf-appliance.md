Dr. Ventimiglia has advanced training in osteopathy and functional dentistry using the Advanced Lightwire Functional (ALF) appliance.

## What is the ALF Appliance?

The ALF is a lightweight, removable dental appliance designed to gently guide the development and alignment of the jaw and facial structures. Unlike traditional orthodontic approaches that focus primarily on straightening teeth, the ALF works with the body's natural growth patterns to address underlying structural and functional issues.

## A Team Approach

Dr. Ventimiglia utilizes a collaborative approach with dentists and myofunctional therapists. As children and adults undergo treatment with the ALF appliance, her osteopathic care supports the structural changes taking place throughout the body — not just in the mouth and jaw.

This team-based model ensures that treatment addresses the whole patient, with each provider contributing their area of expertise.

## Who Benefits from ALF Treatment?
