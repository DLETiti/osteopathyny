Dr. Ventimiglia provides osteopathic care for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. She also offers house calls for new mothers and newborns.

## Pregnancy Care

Osteopathic treatment during pregnancy can help address the musculoskeletal changes that occur as the body adapts throughout each trimester. As the body shifts to accommodate a growing baby, areas of tension and restriction can develop — contributing to discomfort and affecting overall function.

Dr. Ventimiglia's gentle, hands-on approach supports the body through these changes, helping to maintain comfort and optimal function.

## Postpartum & Newborn Care

Dr. Ventimiglia will conduct postpartum house calls for new mothers and newborns if requested. This allows new families to receive care in the comfort of their home during the early days after birth.

Postpartum treatment supports the mother's recovery, while newborn assessment can identify any structural issues early — particularly those that may affect feeding, comfort, or development.
