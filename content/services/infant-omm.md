I treat infants and children with cranial osteopathic manipulative medicine. This gentle, hands-on approach works with the body's natural healing processes to address structural issues that can affect a child's comfort and development.

## Conditions Treated

- Feeding difficulties and latching challenges
- Torticollis (head tilting or turning preference)
- Cranial asymmetry (plagiocephaly)
- Reflux
- Colic

## What to Expect

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** *To describe: What happens during an infant's first visit? How long is a typical session? How many sessions are usually needed? What should parents bring or prepare?*

Treatment is gentle and non-invasive. I use my hands to assess and treat areas of restriction or imbalance, supporting the infant's body in its natural development.

## Working with Lactation Consultants

I work closely with lactation consultants throughout NYC. If your infant is experiencing breastfeeding challenges that may have a structural component — such as a shallow latch, difficulty turning to one side, or tension that affects feeding — osteopathic treatment may help.

If you're a lactation consultant interested in collaborating, please visit the [For Providers](/referring-providers/) page.
