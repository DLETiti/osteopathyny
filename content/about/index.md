I treat infants with cranial osteopathic manipulative medicine who have feeding issues, torticollis, cranial asymmetry, reflux, and colic. I also lecture to and work closely with many lactation consultants in NYC.

I have advanced training in osteopathy and functional dentistry using the Advanced Lightwire Functional (ALF) appliance. I utilize a team approach with dentists and myofunctional therapists as child and adult patients undergo treatment with ALF.

I treat many adult patients with various musculoskeletal and neurologic presentations, such as neck/back pain, migraine, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), arthritis, stenosis, lymphedema, and joint issues. I also treat patients during pregnancy and will conduct postpartum house calls for new mothers and newborns if requested.
