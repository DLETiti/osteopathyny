## What is osteopathic manipulative medicine?

Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) is a hands-on approach to diagnosis and treatment. As an osteopathic physician, I use my hands to identify areas of restriction, tension, or imbalance in the body's structure — and then use gentle techniques to help the body restore itself to better function.

## What is the difference between a D.O. and an M.D.?

Both D.O.s (Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine) and M.D.s (Medical Doctors) are fully licensed physicians who can diagnose, treat, prescribe medication, and perform surgery. D.O.s receive additional training in osteopathic manipulative medicine, which gives us a hands-on approach to evaluating and treating the musculoskeletal system.

## How is OMM different from chiropractic care?

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** *To answer in my own words — this is one of the most common questions patients ask.*

While both involve hands-on treatment, osteopathic physicians complete medical school and residency training, giving us a broader medical perspective. OMM considers the whole body — not just the spine — and uses a variety of gentle techniques tailored to each patient.
